# How to Use the Translation System

## ✅ What's Working Now

The following components are **fully translated** and will change from English to French when you click the EN/FR toggle button:

### Fully Translated Components:
1. ✅ **Navbar** - All menu items (Home, About, Products, Contact, etc.)
2. ✅ **Login Modal** - All form fields and buttons
3. ✅ **Register Modal** - All form fields and buttons  
4. ✅ **Hero Section** - Title, subtitle, and buttons
5. ✅ **Certificate & Trust Page** - All text including cards

### How to Test:
1. Start the app: `npm start`
2. Look at the top-right of the navbar - you'll see the **EN / FR** toggle button
3. Click **FR** - All translated components will change to French
4. Click **EN** - Everything returns to English
5. Navigate between pages - the language persists!

## 🎯 What Changes When You Switch Languages

When you click the FR button:
- **Navbar**: "Home" → "Accueil", "About" → "À propos", etc.
- **Hero**: "Professional Backyard Solutions" → "Contrôle Professionnel des Taupes pour Votre Jardin"
- **Certificate Page**: "Certifications & Trust" → "Certifications et Confiance"
- **Login/Register**: "Sign In" → "Se Connecter", "Sign Up" → "S'inscrire"

## 📋 What's NOT Yet Translated

These components still need translations (they will remain in English):
- ⏳ About page (full content)
- ⏳ Contact page (form and info)
- ⏳ Testimonials page
- ⏳ Products page (product cards)
- ⏳ Footer (links and text)

## 🔄 Next Steps to Complete Translation

To add translations to remaining components, follow this pattern:

### Example: Update Contact Component

1. **Import translations:**
```javascript
import { translations } from '../utils/translations';
```

2. **Add language prop:**
```javascript
const Contact = ({ language = 'en' }) => {
  const t = translations[language] || translations.en;
```

3. **Replace hardcoded text:**
```javascript
// Before:
<h1>Get in Touch</h1>

// After:
<h1>{t.contact.title}</h1>
```

4. **The translation is already in** `translations.js` file!

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### The Design NEVER Changes!
- Only the **text content** changes between languages
- All **CSS**, **layouts**, **colors**, **spacing** remain exactly the same
- **Images**, **icons**, **backgrounds** don't change
- **Buttons**, **forms**, **cards** keep the same design

### Language Toggle Button
- Located in top-right of navbar
- EN = English (default)
- FR = French (Français)
- The toggle button itself doesn't need translation - it's universal!

## 🎨 Design Consistency Guarantee

We've ensured:
- ✅ Same HTML structure
- ✅ Same CSS classes  
- ✅ Same component props

The `translations.js` file already includes complete French translations for:
- Navigation

**You just need to connect them to the components!**

## 🚀 Quick Test Guide

2. Click **FR** button (top-right navbar)
3. Navigate to **Certificate and Trust** page
4. See "Certifications et Confiance" instead of "Certifications & Trust"
